I have a dream of making all the things connected at home and to be able to change the ambience based on the current environment. 
To be able to control the A/c based on the current room temperature,
to be able to turn on the ligths based on the ambience in the room, 
switch on the TV and a channel based on  interests of the person living in the house
To be able to know how each appliances is being used over the period of the time
Throw out all the remotes of your appliances and your phone should act as a universal remote.

The options are countless and imagine if you can do all of these stuff from anywhere in the world. That is SmartHome for you

NOTE: The code is messy as of now as this project is still in under construction stage.. :-)
